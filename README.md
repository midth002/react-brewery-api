  ## Description

  With spring creeping around the corner, people are excited to get out and do fun things! What else sounds better than having a beer on a sunny day? Our group was able to put our minds together and create a platform to help users search for breweries by "city" entered. The current weather conditions will also be displayed for the search location to help guide users if the weather conditions are favorable to go sit at a patio for a pint, or if they feel like checking out a micro brewery instead!

  The project is using the React framework. Technology packages included are the react-dom-router, bulma components for styling the web application, and fontawesome for some icons.

  The search page is where users can find breweries by city name's and see all the breweries that city has to offer.
